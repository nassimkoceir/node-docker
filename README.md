# node-docker (FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSE ONLY)
My first homemade docker container

Use this for development purpose only. It's not safe to use this on production

## 1. How to use this ?
- Clone your GitHub repository in the "application" directory
- Change the name of the directory in the "docker-compose.yml" (in the root) AND in the Dockerfile (in the "application" directory")
- Enjoy

## 2. What was the project ?
The goal was to understand the usage of Docker and Docker-Compose.

## 3. What container did you choose ?
- Node 12 with an Alpine subsystem (the NodeJS image)
- MongoDB (latest) (the database)
- Mongo-Express (latest) (the database manager)

## 4. How to collaborate ?
You can pull request the project. ;)
